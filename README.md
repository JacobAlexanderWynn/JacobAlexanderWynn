# hi!!

i'm jacob wynn (he/him), and i mainly code in python, although i also code in c, c++ and x86_64 assembly sparingly.

i consider myself a beginner / intermediate coder, and any suggestions, corrections or advices are appreciated.

## what i've done

a few of my projects include:

- a simple dice roller including the ability to add and subtract fixed and random numbers, and preset dice (ex: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100)
- an arduino hydroponic germinator with iot integration. i actually presented this @ the Pereira research group zonal convention (Encuentro Zonal de Semilleros de Investigaci√≥n en Pereira) as a research project. (im actually typing this @ the convention rn. might post the code later.)
