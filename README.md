# hi!!

i'm jacob wynn (he/him), and i mainly code in python, although i also code in c, c++ and x86_64 assembly sparingly.

i consider myself a beginner / intermediate coder, and any suggestions, corrections or advices are appreciated.

## what i've done

a few of my projects include:

- a simple dice roller including the ability to add and subtract fixed and random numbers, and preset dice (platonic, d10, d100)
- (not coding, but i guess) a *minecraft* redstone computer for floating point operations.
- an arduino hydroponic germinator for ***lettuces*** (to this day I still find that funny. just. lettuces).
